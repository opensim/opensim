CURRENT PROBLEMS TO FIX AND/OR LOOK AT
=================================================
Vehicle buoyancy. Computed correctly? Possibly creating very large effective mass.
    Interaction of llSetBuoyancy and vehicle buoyancy. Should be additive?
    Negative buoyancy computed correctly
Center-of-gravity
Computation of mesh mass. How done? How should it be done?
Enable vehicle border crossings (at least as poorly as ODE)
	Terrain skirts
	Avatar created in previous region and not new region when crossing border
	Vehicle recreated in new sim at small Z value (offset from root value?) (DONE)
User settable terrain mesh
	Allow specifying as convex or concave and use different getHeight functions depending
Boats, when turning nose down into the water
	Acts like rotation around Z is also effecting rotation around X and Y
Deleting a linkset while standing on the root will leave the physical shape of the root behind.
	Not sure if it is because standing on it. Done with large prim linksets.
Linkset child rotations.
	Nebadon spiral tube has middle sections which are rotated wrong.
	Select linked spiral tube. Delink and note where the middle section ends up.
Teravus llMoveToTarget script debug
	Mixing of hover, buoyancy/gravity, moveToTarget, into one force
	Setting hover height to zero disables hover even if hover flags are on (from SL wiki)
limitMotorUp calibration (more down?)
llRotLookAt
llLookAt
Convert to avatar mesh capsule. Include rotation of capsule.
Vehicle script tuning/debugging
	Avanti speed script
	Weapon shooter script
Move material definitions (friction, ...) into simulator.
osGetPhysicsEngineVerion() and create a version code for the C++ DLL
One sided meshes? Should terrain be built into a closed shape?
	When meshes get partially wedged into the terrain, they cannot push themselves out.
	It is possible that Bullet processes collisions whether entering or leaving a mesh.
	Ref: http://bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=4869
Small physical objects do not interact correctly
    Create chain of .5x.5x.1 torui and make all but top physical so to hang.
        The chain will fall apart and pairs will dance around on ground
    Chains of 1x1x.2 will stay connected but will dance.
    Chains above 2x2x.4 are more stable and get stablier as torui get larger.

VEHICLES TODO LIST:
=================================================
LINEAR_MOTOR_DIRECTION values should be clamped to reasonable numbers.
	What are the limits in SL?
	Same for other velocity settings.
UBit improvements to remove rubber-banding of avatars sitting on vehicle child prims:
	https://github.com/UbitUmarov/Ubit-opensim
Some vehicles should not be able to turn if no speed or off ground.
Cannot edit/move a vehicle being ridden: it jumps back to the origional position.
Neb car jiggling left and right
	Happens on terrain and any other mesh object. Flat cubes are much smoother.
	This has been reduced but not eliminated.
Implement referenceFrame for all the motion routines.
Verify llGetVel() is returning a smooth and good value for vehicle movement.
llGetVel() should return the root's velocity if requested in a child prim.
Implement function efficiency for lineaar and angular motion.
Linkset explosion after three "rides" on Nebadon lite vehicle (LinksetConstraint)
Remove vehicle angular velocity zeroing in BSPrim.UpdateProperties().
	A kludge that isn't fixing the real problem of Bullet adding extra motion.
Incorporate inter-relationship of angular corrections. For instance, angularDeflection
	and angularMotorUp will compute same X or Y correction. When added together
	creates over-correction and over-shoot and wabbling.
Vehicle attributes are not restored when a vehicle is rezzed on region creation
	Create vehicle, setup vehicle properties, restart region, vehicle is not reinitialized.
What to do if vehicle and prim buoyancy differ?

GENERAL TODO LIST:
=================================================
Resitution of a prim works on another prim but not on terrain.
	The dropped prim doesn't bounce properly on the terrain.
Add a sanity check for PIDTarget location.
Level-of-detail for mesh creation. Prims with circular interiors require lod of 32.
	Is much saved with lower LODs? At the moment, all set to 32.
Collisions are inconsistant: arrows are supposed to hit and report collision. Often don't.
	If arrow show at prim, collision reported about 1/3 of time. If collision reported,
	both arrow and prim report it. The arrow bounces off the prim 9 out of 10 times.
	Shooting 5m sphere "arrows" at 60m/s.
llMoveToTarget objects are not effected by gravity until target is removed.
Compute CCD parameters based on body size
Can solver iterations be changed per body/shape? Can be for constraints but what
	about regular vehicles?
Implement llSetPhysicalMaterial.
	extend it with Center-of-mass, rolling friction, density
Implement llSetForceAndTorque.
Change BSPrim.moveToTarget to used forces rather than changing position
	Changing position allows one to move through walls
Implement an avatar mesh shape. The Bullet capsule is way too limited.
	Consider just hand creating a vertex/index array in a new BSShapeAvatar.
Verify/fix phantom, volume-detect objects do not fall to infinity. Should stop at terrain.
Revisit CollisionMargin. Builders notice the 0.04 spacing between prims.
Duplicating a physical prim causes old prim to jump away
	Dup a phys prim and the original become unselected and thus interacts w/ selected prim.
Scenes with hundred of thousands of static objects take a lot of physics CPU time.
Gun sending shooter flying.
Collision margin (gap between physical objects lying on each other)
Boundry checking (crashes related to crossing boundry)
    Add check for border edge position for avatars and objects.
    Verify the events are created for border crossings.
Implement ShapeCollection.Dispose()
Implement water as a plain or mesh so raycasting and collisions can happen with same.
Add collision penetration return
	Add field passed back by BulletSim.dll and fill with info in ManifoldConstact.GetDistance()
Linkset.Position and Linkset.Orientation requre rewrite to properly return
	child position. LinksetConstraint acts like it's at taint time!!
Implement LockAngularMotion -- implements llSetStatus(ROTATE_AXIS_*, T/F)
Should the different PID factors have non-equal contributions for different
	values of Efficiency?
Selecting and deselecting physical objects causes CPU processing time to jump
	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjg57fWg8yI&hd=1
	put thousand physical objects, select and deselect same. CPU time will be large.
Re-implement buoyancy as a separate force on the object rather than diddling gravity.
	Register a pre-step event to add the force.
More efficient memory usage when passing hull information from BSPrim to BulletSim
Physical and phantom will drop through the terrain


LINKSETS
======================================================
Child prims do not report collisions
Allow children of a linkset to be phantom:
	http://opensim-dev.2196679.n2.nabble.com/Setting-a-single-child-prim-to-Phantom-tp7578513.html
	Add OS_STATUS_PHANTOM_PRIM to llSetLinkPrimitaveParamsFast.
Editing a child of a linkset causes the child to go phantom
	Move a child prim once when it is physical and can never move it again without it going phantom
Offset the center of the linkset to be the geometric center of all the prims
	Not quite the same as the center-of-gravity
Linksets should allow collisions to individual children
	Add LocalID to children shapes in LinksetCompound and create events for individuals
LinksetCompound: when one of the children changes orientation (like tires
	turning on a vehicle, the whole compound object is rebuilt. Optimize this
	so orientation/position of individual children can change without a rebuild.
Verify/think through scripts in children of linksets. What do they reference
	and return when getting position, velocity, ...
Confirm constraint linksets still work after making all the changes for compound linksets.
Use PostTaint callback to do rebuilds for constraint linksets to reduce rebuilding
Add 'changed' flag or similar to reduce the number of times a linkset is rebuilt.
	For compound linksets, add ability to remove or reposition individual child shapes.
Speed up creation of large physical linksets
	For instance, sitting in Neb's car (130 prims) takes several seconds to become physical.
	REALLY bad for very large physical linksets (freezes the sim for many seconds).
Eliminate collisions between objects in a linkset. (LinksetConstraint)
    Have UserPointer point to struct with localID and linksetID?
    Objects in original linkset still collide with each other?

MORE
======================================================
Compute avatar size and scale correctly. Now it is a bit off from the capsule size.
Create tests for different interface components
	Have test objects/scripts measure themselves and turn color if correct/bad
	Test functions in SL and calibrate correctness there
	Create auto rezzer and tracker to run through the tests
Do we need to do convex hulls all the time? Can complex meshes be left meshes?
	There is some problem with meshes and collisions
	Hulls are not as detailed as meshes. Hulled vehicles insides are different shape.
Debounce avatar contact so legs don't keep folding up when standing.
Add border extensions to terrain to help region crossings and objects leaving region.
Use a different capsule shape for avatar when sitting
	LL uses a pyrimidal shape scaled by the avatar's bounding box
	http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/File:Avmeshforms.png
Performance test with lots of avatars. Can BulletSim support a thousand?
Optimize collisions in C++: only send up to the object subscribed to collisions.
    Use collision subscription and remove the collsion(A,B) and collision(B,A)
Check whether SimMotionState needs large if statement (see TODO).
Implement 'top colliders' info.
Avatar jump
Performance measurement and changes to make quicker.
Implement detailed physics stats (GetStats()).
Measure performance improvement from hulls
Test not using ghost objects for volume detect implementation.
Performance of closures and delegates for taint processing
	Are there faster ways?
	Is any slowdown introduced by the existing implementation significant?
Is there are more efficient method of implementing pre and post step actions?
	See http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29922/Weak-Events-in-C
Physics Arena central pyramid: why is one side permiable?
In SL, perfect spheres don't seem to have rolling friction. Add special case.
Enforce physical parameter min/max:
	Gravity: [-1, 28]
	Friction: [0, 255]
	Density: [1, 22587]
	Restitution [0, 1]
	http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Physics_Material_Settings_test
Avatar attachments have no mass? http://forums-archive.secondlife.com/54/f0/31796/1.html
Keep avatar scaling correct. http://pennycow.blogspot.fr/2011/07/matter-of-scale.html

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT/CLEANUP
=================================================
Create the physical wrapper classes (BulletBody, BulletShape) by methods on
	BSAPITemplate and make their actual implementation Bullet engine specific.
	For the short term, just call the existing functions in ShapeCollection.
Consider moving prim/character body and shape destruction in destroy()
	to postTimeTime rather than protecting all the potential sets that
	might have been queued up.
Remove unused fields from ShapeData (not used in API2)
Remove unused fields from pinned memory shared parameter block
	Create parameter variables in BSScene to replace same.
Breakout code for mesh/hull/compound/native into separate BSShape* classes
    Standardize access to building and reference code.
	The skeleton classes are in the sources but are not complete or linked in.
Make BSBody and BSShape real classes to centralize creation/changin/destruction
	Convert state and parameter calls from BulletSimAPI direct calls to
		calls on BSBody and BSShape
Generalize Dynamics and PID with standardized motors.
Generalize Linkset and vehicles into PropertyManagers
    Methods for Refresh, RemoveBodyDependencies, RestoreBodyDependencies
	Potentially add events for shape destruction, etc.
Better mechanism for resetting linkset set and vehicle parameters when body rebuilt.
	BSPrim.CreateGeomAndObject is kludgy with the callbacks, etc.
Implement linkset by setting position of children when root updated. (LinksetManual)
	Linkset implementation using manual prim movement.
LinkablePrim class? Would that simplify/centralize the linkset logic?
BSScene.UpdateParameterSet() is broken. How to set params on objects?
Add floating motor for BS_FLOATS_ON_WATER so prim and avatar will
    bob at the water level. BSPrim.PositionSanityCheck()
Should taints check for existance or activeness of target?
	When destroying linksets/etc, taints can be generated for objects that are
	actually gone when the taint happens. Crashes don't happen because the taint closure
	keeps the object from being freed, but that is just an accident.
	Possibly have an 'active' flag that is checked by the taint processor?
Parameters for physics logging should be moved from BSScene to BSParam (at least boolean ones)
Can some of the physical wrapper classes (BulletBody, BulletWorld, BulletShape) be 'sealed'?
There are TOO MANY interfaces from BulletSim core to Bullet itself
	Think of something to eliminate one or more of the layers

THREADING
=================================================
Do taint action immediately if not actually executing Bullet.
	Add lock around Bullet execution and just do taint actions if simulation is not happening.

    Resolution: NOT DONE: SL and ODE define meter square as being at one corner with one diagional.
Terrain as mesh. (Resolution: done)
How are static linksets seen by the physics engine?

Linkset implementation using compound shapes. (Resolution: implemented LinksetCompound)
    Compound shapes will need the LocalID in the shapes and collision
    processing to get it from there.

llMoveToTarget (Resolution: added simple motor to update the position.)
Angular motor direction is global coordinates rather than local coordinates (DONE)
Add vehicle collisions so IsColliding is properly reported. (DONE)
	Needed for banking, limitMotorUp, movementLimiting, ...
	(Resolution: added CollisionFlags.BS_VEHICLE_COLLISION and code to use it)
VehicleAddForce is not scaled by the simulation step but it is only
	applied for one step. Should it be scaled? (DONE)
	(Resolution: use force for timed things, Impulse for immediate, non-timed things)
Complete implemention of preStepActions (DONE)
	Replace vehicle step call with prestep event.
	Is there a need for postStepActions? postStepTaints?
Disable activity of passive linkset children. (DONE)
	Since the linkset is a compound object, the old prims are left lying

    Since C++ code does not need terrain height, this structure et al are not needed.
Surfboard go wonky when turning (DONE)

	(Resolution: made angular motor direction correct coordinate system)
Mantis 6040 script http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6040 (DONE)
	Msg Kayaker on OSGrid when working
	(Resolution: LINEAR_DIRECTION is in vehicle coords. Test script does the
	same in SL as in OS/BulletSim)
Boats float low in the water (DONE)
Boats floating at proper level (DONE)
When is force introduced by SetForce removed? The prestep action could go forever. (DONE)

	(DONE 20130520: normalize rotations)
Hitting RESET on Nebadon's vehicle while riding causes vehicle to get into odd
	position state where it will not settle onto ground properly, etc
	(DONE 20130520: normalize rotations)
Two of Nebadon vehicles in a sim max the CPU. This is new.
	(DONE 20130520: two problems: if asset failed to mesh, constantly refetched
	asset; vehicle was sending too many messages to all linkset members)
Add material densities to the material types. (WILL NOT BE DONE: not how it is done)
Avatars walking up stairs (DONE)
Avatar movement
	flying into a wall doesn't stop avatar who keeps appearing to move through the obstacle (DONE)

Vehicles (Move smoothly)
For limitMotorUp, use raycast down to find if vehicle is in the air.
	(WILL NOT BE DONE: gravity does the job well enough)
BSPrim.Force should set a continious force on the prim. The force should be
	applied each tick.  Some limits?

Add PID motor for avatar movement (slow to stop, ...) (WNBD: current works ok)
Avatar movement motor check for zero or small movement. Somehow suppress small movements
	when avatar has stopped and is just standing. Simple test for near zero has
	the problem of preventing starting up (increase from zero) especially when falling.
	(DONE: avatar movement actor knows if standing on stationary object and zeros motion)
Can the 'inTaintTime' flag be cleaned up and used? For instance, a call to
	BSScene.TaintedObject() could immediately execute the callback if already in taint time.
