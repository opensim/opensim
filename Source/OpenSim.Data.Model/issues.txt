The column 'AgentPrefs.LanguageIsPublic' would normally be mapped to a non-nullable bool property, but it has a default constraint. Such a column is mapped to a nullable bool property to allow a difference between setting the property to false and invoking the default constraint. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851278 for details.
