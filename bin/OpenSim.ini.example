;; Once you have copied OpenSim.ini.example to OpenSim.ini you will at least

;;
;; All settings are initially commented out and the default value used, as 
;; found in OpenSimDefaults.ini.  To change a setting, first uncomment it by 
;; deleting the initial semicolon (;) and then change the value.  This will
